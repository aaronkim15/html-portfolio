<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Aaron Kim. I am 21 years old, and I am currently attending my third year at Wilfrid Laurier University! 
  I am taking an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I am currently trying to expand my skillset so that I will be
  capable to handle many jobs and opportunities in the future!
</p>

<p>I am from Stratford, Ontario. I grew up playing lots of recreational sports with friends, and I also played lots of
  video games like Pokemon, Minecraft when growing up. In my free time, I try to spend a decent chunk on time doing 
  lots of coding or school related projects/assignments so I can stay up to date and improve slowly overtime. 
</p>

<p>I really like the idea of coding and the history behind how it became. There are many different types of opportunities
  that I can take, which is really exciting! I am quite motivated to see where this career will take me, and hopefully
  somewhere I can see my self doing for a long time! Thank you for reading my little get to know me page! I hope to see
  you soon!
