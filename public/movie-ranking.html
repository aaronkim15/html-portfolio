<h1>The Best Movies According to Aaron</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Howls Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
    This is my favourite movie because it was one of the first 
    memorable movies that was introduced to me from my sisters.
    I remember watching it on my sisters laptop when I was at 
    a Korean bath-house around the age of 6.

<h3>Fast and Furious: Toyko Drift</h3>
<p> 
    This is a close second for me, the overall Fast and Furious
    series is okay. But the older movies really held a warm part of my 
    childhood. Especially Tokyo Drift, this movies introduced a whole
    lifestyle not only in cars, but how people at that time lived in Japan.
    this really struck a love for being a Young Asian male.

<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>
    Deadpool was a solid third for me, this is because Deadpool is just
    a really funny movie, while containing the entertaining aspect of
    action. Deadpool wasn't all that memerable in my childhood, but I 
    always went back to it because it was a classic funny movie.
